# Setup Scripts

This repository contains setup scripts for various operating systems. These scripts automate the installation and configuration of various development tools and software.

## Scripts Included

Currently, the following setup scripts are available:

- [x] `setup-deb.sh`: For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, ElementaryOS)
- [x] `setup-arch.sh`: For Arch-based systems (e.g., Arch Linux, Manjaro, EndeavourOS)
- [x] `test.sh`: A testing script for checking the installation of software
- [ ] `setup-win.bat`: For Windows (coming soon)

## Usage

To use these scripts, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kasutu/setup.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the setup script.
    ```bash
    cd setup
    ```
3. Make the script executable with the following command (for Unix-like systems):
   > Please note that this script requires `sudo` privileges to install and configure software.
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x setup-<your-os>.sh
    ```
4. Run the script with the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo sh setup-<your-os>.sh [OPTIONS]
    ```
    ```bash
    sudo bash setup-<your-os>.sh [OPTIONS]
    ```

Replace `<your-os>` with `deb` or `arch` depending on the script you want to run.

## Testing

6. Once the setup script has completed, you can perform testing of the installed software using the `test.sh` script. Run it with the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo sh test.sh
   ```
